<a href='https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/intro-to-ml/supervised'>Supervised learning</a>: is a type of machine learning in which machine learn
from known datasets (set of training examples), and then predict the output.
A supervised learning agent needs to find out the function that matches a given sample set.
Supervised learning further can be classified into two categories of algorithms:

1) Regression : When the outcome is pure numeric value. 
	eg : Home price prediction. You are trying to estimate value of price.

2) Classification : When the outcome is a category/class. 
	eg: Fraud detection. You are trying to identify Yes/No class

However in this repository we will be focusing solely on the following classification algorithms:
